# Week 7 - Structure and Code - developing web pages
There are resources and code on this page for the week 7 workshop. There are also optional resources, the code for those is in the optional_code/data folder on this page.

## Homework
Take one of your P5.js project and put it on a web page. Use CSS to style the web page and place the p5.js canvas within it, so it looks like a designed web page.

There is a shared document for this workshop, I'll will give you the link during the workshop. When you have made your page, I would like you to take a screen shot and paste it into this document. If you upload your page to GitHub pages, put in the link as well.

Really push the design of the page, use CSS so the page looks complete.

## Core Workshop content
This looks at project structure and how to think about coding. It partly uses a p5.js project. There are some resources that might help with this section and also some reference material that I used to make this workshop.

### Resources
#### Browser Development Tools
It is hard to create web project without using the browsers developer tools. I mainly use Firefox or Chrome tools.

[Firefox developer tools](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Tools#:~:text=You%20can%20open%20the%20Firefox,%2B%20Opt%20%2B%20I%20on%20macOS.)

[Chrome developer tools](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/chrome-devtools)

#### Web site design
If your interested in web site design [sidebar.io](https://sidebar.io/) has links to interesting articles on user interface (UI) and user experience (UX) design.

#### p5.js
The [p5.js getting started](https://p5js.org/get-started/) guide has a section of moving code from their online editor to your web page.

#### HTML Input fields
There are plenty of references on line on HTML input elements, these are a couple I found:

[Tutorial HTML](https://tutorialehtml.com/en/html-tutorial-text-fields/)

[Tutorial Deep](https://tutorialdeep.com/html_tutorial/text-field-html-form/)

## Optional Workshop Content
There are four optional videos to watch this week:
- Publishing a web site using GitHub pages
- Making a p5.js project a background for a web page
- Finding and fixing Errors
- Importing data from files into an HTML page.

### GitHub pages
Github has some useful guides to pages:
[GitHub tutorials](https://lab.github.com/githubtraining/paths)

[Getting started with GitHub pages](https://pages.github.com/)
[Creating more complex GitHub pages](https://lab.github.com/githubtraining/github-pages)

### Making a p5.js project a background for a web page
p5.js creates content on an HTML canvas element. This can be used as a background for the page, which means you could create an interactive background that has other content on it.

In the optional_code folder the file canvas.html does this. The resources I used for this are:

[Stackoverflow, SET HTML Canvas as a background](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/14043359/set-html-canvas-as-page-background)

[Making the canvas responsive](https://p5js.org/reference/#/p5/windowResized)

### Finding and fixing Errors
I have created a glitch that has a number of errors in it. Remix this glitch and choose edit. Show the page and use the developer tools to see the errors and fix them in the code. There is an answers.html in case you can't find any of them.

### Importing data files into an HTML page
If you go through the video on importing data, you will need to use a python server. I go through how to do this in the video. Their are two commands to start the server depending on if you are using python version 2 or 3.

Python 2 server command ```python -m SimpleHTTPServer```

Python 3 server command ```python -m http.server```

Python is installed on Mac's and PC's, to find which version is on your computer open a terminal and type the following command: 

```python --version```
