# Unit 3 Physical Computing
This repository contains information and code for the physical computing unit for the Diploma in Creative Computing of the Creative Computing Institute.

The Unit will be using Arduino's to expore physical computing. It will also explore how physical and digital computing can be intergrated to create interactive systems. By using the idea of play you will be creating interactive physical systems using a range of inputs and outputs. 

## Physical Computing
 Physical computing allows you to created programmed systems that are manifested with physical objects. This could be objects that sense and interact with the world, that respond to data, that send data that change other systems, or a mixture of the three.
