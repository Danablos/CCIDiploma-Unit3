# Unit 3 Physical Computing
This repository contains information and code for the physical computing unit for the Diploma in Creative Computing of the Creative Computing Institute.

The Unit will be using Arduino's to explore physical computing. It will also explore how physical and digital computing can be integrated to create interactive systems. By using the idea of play you will be creating interactive physical systems using a range of inputs and outputs. 

## Physical Computing
 Physical computing allows you to create programmed systems that are manifested with physical objects. This could be objects that sense and interact with the world, that respond to data, that send data that change other systems, or a mixture of the three.

## Assessment
For your assessment you need to produce a physical computing project based around the idea of play. You need to create a video to present the project as well as a pdf document detailing your project. This is an individual project, that should demonstrate your learning during the unit as well as your interpretation of the brief (add link to brief).

## Play
In this unit you will be creating a physical computing project based around play. Play can be many things, it could be a game, imaginary situations or explorational. It is enjoyable, imaginative, mainly voluntary and active.

## Week 1 - Thursday 22nd October 2020: Introduction to Physical computing
This workshop will include an introduction to physical computing, Arduino and play. There will be a demonstration on setting up the Arduino programming environment and getting started with some basic components. You will start to connect components to an Arduino and write a short program.

### Homework
Over the next three weeks, in groups of three you will be going through the Arduino project book as homework. 

## Week 2 - Thursday 29th October 2020: Introduction to JavaScript and Node.js
If you want to mix physical components with digital interfaces using a browser page is a good way to do it, which means getting to know some web languages including HTML, CSS and JavaScript. This workshop will be an introduction to JavaScript and Node.js. JavaScript
