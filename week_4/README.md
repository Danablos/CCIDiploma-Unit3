# Week 4: Arduino Data to a Web Page
This week we will start looking at how to send data from an Arduino to a web page. You will be doing this by creating a Node.js application. This application will have code so you can use your computer as a local server, as well the code needed to get the data from the Arduino. 

You will be using visual studio code, Arduino, and Node.js to do this. You will also be referencing the port your Arduino is attached to bring in the data. I will go through getting started with Visual Studio code and setting up the folder and files for the Node.js server. Then I will go through the connection to the Arduino and how to transfer data from the Arduino, to the server, to a web page.

## Setting up the Arduino
You will need an Arduino, a button component, a 220-ohm resistor, a bread board and 4 jump wires. The connection of the button to the Arduino is shown below:
