# Week 9 - Mixing Physical and Digital: Node.js and Arduino
The aim of this weeks workshop is to get comfortable using a Node.js server with an Arduino to pass data to create visualistions.

This will be done with a Node.js library called socket.io. socket.io has functions to let you pass data from the server to a web page, or a web page to a server as soon as that data arrives. 

This workshop will use Arduino and Node.js, with the Node.js libraries Express, serialport and socket.io.

## Homework
Create a simple Arduino set up and send data from to a Node.js application that visualises the data.

## Resources
Here are some resources relating to today's videos. There are folders for each step for creating the Node.js Arduino projects:


## Folder and File Structures in Node.js applications
In the video I mention favacons, this is some more information about them [favacons](https://www.seoptimer.com/blog/what-is-a-favicon/)
