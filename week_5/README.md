## Week 5 homework
The homework for this week will be to continue to go through the Arduino project book. Also go through any of the resources that interest you in the shared document.

Also, see how you could add JavaScript to the web pages in the workshop, how could you change content and make the pages interactive.

## Optional Material 
There are many areas of HTML, CSS and JavaScript that you may be interested in. I have compiled some links to resources so you can choose which are interested in to look during the workshop. Try remixing the content so you get an understanding of what HTML and CSS can do. 

I would recommend looking through the resources in the CSS and HTML section. Have a look through the JavaScript resources too, the w3schools is quite long so this might be something you want to work though in the week. 

### CSS and HTML 
I could only scratch the surface of HTML and CSS in the videos. The following are some resources to go further with them. There are resources that show the different HTML and CSS elements as well as some tutorials on layout.

#### Glitch
I created a glitch project for a previous workshop on HTML and CSS, there are several HTML pages examples to look through. The README file has a lot of the information I talk through in the video.

### JavaScript 
These are some resources to help you with using JavaScript to create interactions on web pages.

### CodePen 
CodePen is an online development environment where you can see examples of web animations and layouts. You can also see the HTML, CSS and JavaScript for the project. If there is something you want to try out, do a search on the site and you can find good examples.

### More layout 
If you are interested in the layout of HTML pages, you should investigate flexbox and CSS grid. With them you can create responsive layouts.

### SVG Animation 
SVG's work well with HTML. You can animate SVGâ€™s that are created with HTML or by software such as Illustrator. Below are some links to get you started.
