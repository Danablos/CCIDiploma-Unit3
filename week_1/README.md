## Installing the Arduino IDE
An IDE is an integrated development environment, it has extra features to help you code. There is an IDE for Arduino that is easy to install, you can use an online version, but I have found it easier to have it downloaded locally on my computer. To download the Arduino IDE:

1. Go to the download page on the [Arduino IDE](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/Software)
2. Go down the page until you see Download the Arduino IDE and choose the right version for you from the list on the right hand side - I chose Windows Installer for my PC
3. This will open a new page which will let you contribute and download or just download
4. Once the file is downloaded double click on it to install
