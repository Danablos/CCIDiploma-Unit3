# Week 7 - The structure of physical computing projects: breaking down the process
The aim this week is to think about how physical projects are made; the different components and systems and how they link together. This will be then put into practice by planning out then building a remix of one of the Arduino projects in the Arduino project groups. This will be undertaken in small groups and can be completed as homework.

## Homework
In small groups design and build a remix of one of the projects in the Arduino project book. Base it around play and include a user interaction. In the shared document (I'll share the link during the workshop) write a few paragraphs to describe the project, how you broke it down into sections and the decisions you made in building it, include pictures of sketches and the final outcome.

## Resources
This section has some links to information about how the physical projects included in this workshop have been made. Not all the projects I've listed in the shared document have full documentation on how the project was made, but I've put in the links I could find. Please don't read these before you've had a go at working out how they might have been made.

### Wishing Wall
This project is very well documented, with all the code on GitHub and other web pages describing how it was made:
