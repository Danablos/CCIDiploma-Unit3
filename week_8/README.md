# Week 8 - The structure of physical computing projects: breaking down the process
The aim this week is to think about how physical projects are made; the different components and systems and how they link together. This will be then put into practice by planning out then building a remix of one of the Arduino projects in the Arduino project groups. This will be undertaken in small groups and can be completed as homework.

## Homework
In small groups design and build a remix of one of the projects in the Arduino project book. Base it around play and include a user interaction. In the shared document (I'll share the link during the workshop) write a few paragraphs to describe the project, how you broke it down into sections and the decisions you made in building it, include pictures of sketches and the final outcome.

## Resources
This section has some links to information about how the physical projects included in this workshop have been made. Not all the projects I've listed in the shared document have full documentation on how the project was made, but I've put in the links I could find. Please don't read these before you've had a go at working out how they might have been made.

### Wishing Wall
This project is very well documented, with all the code on GitHub and other web pages describing how it was made:

### Daily tous les jours -I heard there was a secret chord  
This is a data choir. The piece consists of a room and a website. Both continuously broadcast Hallelujah’s melody, hummed by a virtual choir. This choir of humming voices is directly impacted by the visitors. Whether they are listening online or in-situ, the number of voices heard increases and decreases as a result of their presence. The fluctuating number is displayed in real time. 

I couldn't find out that much on how it was actually made.

### Sasha Afanasieva – BluBel 
BluBel is a direction system for bikes. It looks like a bicycle bell and can be attached to the handle bars. The bell has a ring of 12 lights that light up to show you where to turn, and plays a sound alert when a turn approach. 

Blubel, connects to a smartphone to relay turn-by-turn directions–and every time someone rings the bell, the data goes to a crowdsourced database to help map out safer, quieter, routes. 

I couldn’t find much information on how it was made, thought I went to a talk where she presented, and an Arduino was used for the prototype.

### Introbots 
Introbots find it really tiresome to be in the spotlight. They are more comfortable in dark spaces and tend to move away from bright lights. If they’re left in peace, their LEDs blink calmly. Vice versa, if they’re pushed too much into a bright space, they panic, and either spin or freeze. Just like all introverted people are different, each IntroBot has a different personality with different thresholds and resistance to stimuli. 

A small game or performance is part of the Introbot experience: four participants are given a torchlight each, divided into teams of two, and led into a dark room. Four robots are waiting there, a pair for each side of the space. Their LEDs are glowing as if they’re relaxing and chatting with one another. Players are told that the objective of the game is to bring the Introbots to the center of the room, but this is much more difficult than it seems: the robots are scared of lights, they often run away, they get confused by the shadows and by the other players’ torches. And sometimes they panic and start spinning in random directions.  They used Arduino. 

The video on this page does give an explanation on how they were built, so have a look at it after you’ve thought about how it might be made.

### panGenerator Constellaction 
An installation commissioned by the Copernicus Science Centre; it is a series of light reactive modules that people interact with.
